<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>Today I overheard the conversation of my coworkers, they wanted to show the school's page through a QR Code that would be placed on the main screen of the auditorium, so that people could scan the code and have quick access to the school's page . I offered to help, because some time ago I wanted to do a qr code generator project, so I thought this was a very good opportunity to do the project and at the same time help the place where I work.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can help my partners of work by making this project, and also learning a little bit more about APIs.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>To use the project is simple, just write the URL or text and click in the generator button or press the enter key, and it will generate a totally work QR Code form the QR Code API.</p>

<h2>Tecnologies</h2>
